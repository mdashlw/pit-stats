# Pit Stats

Advanced Stats Viewer for The Hypixel Pit.

## Features

### Stats Viewer

The main purpose of this mod is to provide an improved version of the /view command for viewing inventory/enderchest, selected perks/killstreaks and various Pit statistics.

You can watch a review of this on YouTube: https://youtu.be/RQRD0_a83fI. Please note that this video is slightly
outdated.

Use **/pit <name> (or /pitstats, /pitinfo)** to open the statistics viewer.

### Required Pants for Mystic Items (since v1.3.1)

Display required pants color to Tier III for fresh/T1/T2 mystic items.

This is enabled by default. Use **/pit config pants** to enable/disable it.
